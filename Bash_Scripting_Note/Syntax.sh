# The most basic bash scripts are just lists of Linux commands collected in a single file. 
	
# 	=> For example

# 		# All this script does is create a directory, create a file
# 		# within the directory, and then list the content of the directory.

# 		$mkdir mydirectory
# 		$touch mydirectory/myfile.txt
# 		$ls -l mydirectory
